# Changelog

# **🔔v1.4 – Activity History Update**

# ✨ New Features
- **Activity History panel**
  - Added a new panel to view **XP activity history** for an account.
  - Displays entries as: **Earned "XX" XP** with **timestamp**, **language**, **event type**, and **skill ID**.
  - Activity data is parsed from `language_data.<lang>.calendar[]`.

- **Search activity by User ID**
  - Added a search bar to fetch and view activity history of any user by their **who / user ID**.

- **“Me” quick action**
  - New **Me** button auto-loads the current logged-in account’s activity history.

#  🧠 Data Improvements
- Correctly maps `improvement` → XP earned.
- Uses `datetime` (milliseconds) to render accurate local timestamps.
- Shows **Email verified (true / false)** in the Activity History summary.

#  🎨 UI / UX
- Activity History panel is now **fully centered on screen**.
- Improved readability with:
  - Scrollable activity list
  - Clear XP formatting
  - Responsive layout (desktop & mobile)
- Fixed layout issues causing panels to appear off-screen.

# 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue where Activity History showed *“No activities catched in response”* even when data existed.
- Fixed **“Me” button not fetching own account**.
- Fixed invalid HTML rendering in the summary section.
- Improved JSON handling to avoid empty or invalid response errors.

#  ⚙️ Technical
- Switched activity source from deprecated `courses[].activity[]` to correct `language_data.*.calendar[]`.
- More robust ID resolution for the current user.
